- commander
- right now if you pass no mainRules, it doesnt throw
  but if you dont pass rules to a subdirectory,
  it throws, what to do in this case?
  I think it should not throw
- program.run should accept an array of empty dirs
- rename it to directory-schema-validator
- allow dir rules to be inclusive/exclusive

# DONE
